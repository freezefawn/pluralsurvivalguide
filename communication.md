# Communication 101

## What is it?

In reference to systems, communication is fairly straightforward- its **any communication you have between you and the rest of your system through any medium you can make it happen.**

System communication can happen in a number of different ways, an incomplete list of which we have detailed here;

**Internal Communication**- This is what is usually meant when people talk about system communication, as its the kind of communication that tends to be most desired in systems. It is communication that happens 'inside' the mind without external agents involved. Some common kinds of internal communication include but are not limited to;
- **Dream communication** - communication with headmates through dreams/while sleeping, lucid or otherwise.
- **Tulpish** - also called mentalese or conceptual communication. Raw thought without coherent words but full understanding, simply Knowing what the other party intended to convey.
- **Feelings and sensations** - somatic sensations and bursts of emotion used to communicate. Examples include a headmate intentionally inducing a sensation like headpressure as a response, or causing the body to experience a strong emotion like happiness or fear. Distinct from raw thought in that it is not inherently understood.
- **'Verbal' thought communication** - thinking in coherent words within the internal narrative to one annother. May include having a specific verbal voice or 'flavor' to the voice. This is the 'main' and most prized kind of internal communication among many systems.
- **Inner world** - communicating by having to go to one's inner world first.
- **Imposition and projection** - in which a headmate 'projects' themselves or you 'project' them onto your real life surroundings. With projection is is simply an overlaid 'mind's eye' situation, but for Imposition the goal is to actively induce a hallucination and literally see/feel/hear/etc the headmate.
- **Hallucinations** - systems that have unusual sensory experiences may have a headmate using hallucinations to communicate in some way. The headmate speaking audibly instead of internally is one common example of this. Different from imposition in that the hallucinations are not necessarily the headmate specifically, but rather something they are inducing (ex, sending a hallucination of a spider by your hand to indicate they are not happy with something you said to them, but they themselves are not the spider).
- **Retrospectively referencing memories** - communicating via thinking back on/referencing memories of the things the previous fronter thought and said when they were at front and then thinking thoughts for them to peruse when they return to front later.

**Meatspace Communication**- Communication that involves interfacing with things in the real world.
- **External talking** - communication by way of speaking out loud so that others in the system may respond in some way. Often mixed with other kinds of communication (ex, one speaking internally one externally, switching or co fronting to take turns speaking).
- **Passing notes** - communication by way of writing something down externally. May have immediate response or may be checked and responded to next time the desired recipient fronts.
- **Third party communication** - communicating with a trusted third party who may then in turn pass this message to the next fronter.
- **Co-fronting and partial possession** - using control of the body as a medium to communicate (ex, only being able to internally communicate when co-fronting, partially controlling the body to use body gestures to communicate).

Many systems will use a combination of these methods, or one system member may use one, and one may use another.


## How do I do it?

Several of these are fairly straightforward; you simply speak out loud, you can write notes where your headmate will find them, or just let your headmate take the lead to do certain things and hope for the best.

Internal communication however, can be tricky, especially the much-desired verbal internal communication, and especially at first when you have done no practice whatsoever with this skill.
Its a skill that many systems have difficulty with especially due to dissociative barriers common to many plural folks. It is, however, like all system skills; something that can be improved through work for most systems.

There are various techniques to practice for all of these kinds of communication, though this guide will focus on only a few of the most common and generally preferred options.

## Establishing Communication

First you need to establish any kind of communication at all, and to do that you need to have the right attitude.

Do not come at this from an angry, fearful, or otherwise very negative position if at all possible- come at it from understanding and care. Many headmates will avoid giving a response if they are afraid you will be upset with them, or may lash out if they feel you dislike them.

Let them know it is safe and ok to talk to you. Create and atmosphere that makes them comfortable enough to come forward- even if they try to chase you off. When you put out feelers, try to put that understanding and care into your overtures.
Remember! This is often new and scary for them, too!

Many systems are capable of standard internal communication right off the bat, so first just see if your system is capable of it without practice, as this is generally the most convenient kind of communication.

### Internal Communication Test

First, get comfortable somewhere you will not be disturbed. You want to be able to mostly be paying attention to inside stuff for a bit, so try not to be doing anything that it would be dangerous to be distracted for.

Think into your mind(or out loud, if you feel that would be easier) a greeting, who you are, and a simple question that is hard to get a 'junk' random thought response for (not a yes/no question). Asking for a name is a good example. Try to 'push' this message at your headmate, and then try to 'step back' to listen for a response.

This stepping back is less 'thinking of nothing' and more not trying to control the direction of the thoughts within the internal narrative so hard.

Try to believe as strongly as you can than your headmate can hear you and respond. The power of belief is very strong in system experiences, and doing this can really make a difference.

The response, if you get one, will often feel like when you are thinking to yourself, but it will not quite feel like -you- thought it.

If you get a reply that behaves personlike- congrats! You've done internal communication and should practice and use this.

If not, you have various angles to try going forward.

### The Old Reliable

If you cannot talk reliably internally, the most base level of communication is to try for the tried and true note passing.

If you KNOW you have a headmate that keeps fronting, and you just cannot talk to them inside, try writing a note somewhere they will come across it (but ideally other bodies will not). If you know they keep fronting for certain things, you can try leaving it in that sort of space. Leaving it visible in items that are commonly used for daily life (such as a wallet, computer desktop, journal, or phone) is also a good option.

You will need patience, but this is a reliable fallback option even if you have total blackouts and zero other communication abilities.

## Learning Internal Communication

If you cannot do it first thing, then you will need to build the skill manually if you wish to have it.

### Learning how to listen

WIP WIP WIP

The concept of intentionality and 'you-ness'- deliberately having a thought versus thoughts just sort of happening in there, ascribing your youness to a thought versus not doing that.

in order to learn how to listen you have to stop having all your aggressively you and high in intentionality thoughts everywhere. Learn to let thoughts not be constrolled and deliberate. Meditation, you want a state similar to just before sleep when your thoughts arent really in your deliberate control.

Practice this state in small incriments when comfortable. learn how to 'step back' quickly at will. YOu may struggle wit hthis.

This state makes it easier to hear headmates, as you arent taking up as much space and dont need to be muscled out of the way for them to talk.

### Practicing talking

nararation internally practice.
not everyone thinks in words, it doesnt need to be in words. practice just talking, then practice talking in a direction, then practice switching between talking and the listen

### Inner world method

Imagine a space. Imagine it REALLY detailed. Ok now imagine your headmate and then let go of it and invite them to take form there. Now talk to them and step back on controlling the daydrema a bit. See if they will play with you.
you might only be able to reliably communicate in a more in depth sort of meditative state like this.
