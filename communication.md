# Communication 101

## What is it?

In reference to systems, communication is fairly straightforward- its **any communication you have between you and the rest of your system through any medium you can make it happen.**

System communication can happen in a number of different ways, an incomplete list of which we have detailed here;

**Internal Communication**- This is what is usually meant when people talk about system communication, as its the kind of communication that tends to be most desired in systems. It is communication that happens 'inside' the mind without external agents involved. Some common kinds of internal communication include but are not limited to;
- **Dream communication** - communication with headmates through dreams/while sleeping, lucid or otherwise.
- **Conceptual communication** - also called mentalese or tulpish. Raw thought without coherent words but full understanding, simply Knowing what the other party intended to convey.
- **Feelings and sensations** - somatic sensations and bursts of emotion used to communicate. Examples include a headmate intentionally inducing a sensation like headpressure as a response, or causing the body to experience a strong emotion like happiness or fear. Distinct from raw thought in that it is not inherently understood.
- **'Verbal' thought communication** - thinking in coherent words within the internal narrative to one annother. May include having a specific verbal voice or 'flavor' to the voice. This is the 'main' and most prized kind of internal communication among many systems.
- **Inner world** - communicating by having to go to one's inner world first.
- **Imposition and projection** - in which a headmate 'projects' themselves or you 'project' them onto your real life surroundings. With projection is is simply an overlaid 'mind's eye' situation, but for Imposition the goal is to actively induce a hallucination and literally see/feel/hear/etc the headmate.
- **Hallucinations** - systems that have unusual sensory experiences may have a headmate using hallucinations to communicate in some way. The headmate speaking audibly instead of internally is one common example of this. Different from imposition in that the hallucinations are not necessarily the headmate specifically, but rather something they are inducing (ex, sending a hallucination of a spider by your hand to indicate they are not happy with something you said to them, but they themselves are not the spider).
- **Retrospectively referencing memories** - communicating via thinking back on/referencing memories of the things the previous fronter thought and said when they were at front and then thinking thoughts for them to peruse when they return to front later.

**Meatspace Communication**- Communication that involves interfacing with things in the real world.
- **External talking** - communication by way of speaking out loud so that others in the system may respond in some way. Often mixed with other kinds of communication (ex, one speaking internally one externally, switching or co fronting to take turns speaking).
- **Passing notes** - communication by way of writing something down externally. May have immediate response or may be checked and responded to next time the desired recipient fronts.
- **Third party communication** - communicating with a trusted third party who may then in turn pass this message to the next fronter.
- **Co-fronting and partial possession** - using control of the body as a medium to communicate (ex, only being able to internally communicate when co-fronting, partially controlling the body to use body gestures to communicate).

Many systems will use a combination of these methods, or one system member may use one, and one may use another.


## How do I do it?

Several of these are fairly straightforward; you simply speak out loud, you can write notes where your headmate will find them, or just let your headmate take the lead to do certain things and hope for the best.

Internal communication however, can be tricky, especially the much-desired verbal internal communication, and especially at first when you have done no practice whatsoever with this skill.
Its a skill that many systems have difficulty with especially due to dissociative barriers common to many plural folks. It is, however, like all system skills; something that can be improved through work for most systems.

There are various techniques to practice for all of these kinds of communication, though this guide will focus on only a few of the most common and generally preferred options.

### Mental Framing

One thing that a lot of systems struggle with isn't the skill itself exactly, but the idea of what internal communication actually looks and feels like.

You have to change your outlook on the boundaries of your selfhood- in plurality, **not every thought that happens in your brain is your thought**. The societies that most people reading this guide will have grown up in assert a singular self so hard that its natural to assume every thought that strays in your head is 'you', so it can be an adjustment to move to the idea that this 'you' box is actually smaller than you were thinking it was and then enforce this automatic identification/disidentification.

Even with this in mind though, it can be difficult, as people have very grand ideas of what system activity looks like that are not nessesarily accurate. 

Many folks think its going to feel a lot more seperate and unmistakably foriegn than it tends to actually be. While its true that for some systems (especially systems that have been practicing for a long while) things can be very overt, in many cases it is much more covert and mundane feeling than people may expect.

See, thoughts, wether they are yours or theirs, are going to just feel like thoughts usually, though they may lack the feeling that they are *your* thoughts. Learning to discern which of those thoughts are your thoughts or theirs (if they are co-conscious enough to speak) can be difficult, and requires practice in thinking and examining thoughts to learn.

Members of systems often also have to practice 'sounding' different and 'feeling' different when they communicate, or they will also still just 'sound' like you. Many systems will also find that being tired or stressed means they do not always add on the identification bits in this fashion when they speak up. It is simply not the case that headmate internal communication will always be in a distinct different headvoice and always feel unmistakably foreign.

Because they feel pretty much like regular thoughts and happen in your regular thought train, most systems will find that they simply cannot think separate thoughts at the same time as their headmate, as well.

You all exist in the same brain, and this means you have to all share the same resources- such as space in the internal narrative. Some systems may have or can train abilities that *appear* to allow one to think complex thoughts at the same time as other headmates also doing this, but the science of this actually being the case is HIGHLY controversial.

With expectations managed, time to actually get into it.

## Establishing Communication

First you need to establish any kind of communication at all, and to do that you need to have the right attitude, lest you may have interpersonal problems on top of communication issues.

Do not come at this from an angry, fearful, or otherwise very negative position if at all possible- come at it from understanding and care. Many headmates will avoid giving a response if they are afraid you will be upset with them, or may lash out if they feel you dislike them.

Let them know it is safe and ok to talk to you. Create and atmosphere that makes them comfortable enough to come forward- even if they try to chase you off. When you put out feelers, try to put that understanding and care into your overtures.
Remember! This is often new and scary for them, too!

Many systems are capable of standard internal communication right off the bat, so first just see if your system is capable of it without practice, as this is generally the most convenient kind of communication.

### Internal Communication Test

First, get comfortable somewhere you will not be disturbed. You want to be able to mostly be paying attention to inside stuff for a bit, so try not to be doing anything that it would be dangerous to be distracted for.

Think into your mind(or speak out loud, if you feel that would be easier) a greeting, who you are, and a simple question that is hard to get a 'junk' random thought response for (not a yes/no question). Asking for a name is a good example. Try to 'push' this message at your headmate, and then try to 'step back' to listen for a response.

This stepping back is less 'thinking of nothing' and more not trying to control the direction of the thoughts within the internal narrative so hard.

Try to believe as strongly as you can than your headmate can hear you and respond. The power of belief is very strong in system experiences, and doing this can really make a difference.

The response, if you get one, will often feel and 'sound' like when you are thinking to yourself, but it will not quite feel like -you- thought it.

If you get a reply that behaves personlike- congrats! You've done internal communication and should practice and use this.

If not, you have various angles to try going forward.

### The Old Reliable

If you cannot talk reliably internally, the most base level of communication is to try for the tried and true note passing.

If you KNOW you have a headmate that keeps fronting, and you just cannot talk to them inside, try writing a note somewhere they will come across it (but ideally other bodies will not). If you know they keep fronting for certain things, you can try leaving it in that sort of space. Leaving it visible in items that are commonly used for daily life (such as a wallet, computer desktop, journal, or phone) is also a good option.

You will need patience, but this is a reliable fallback option even if you have total blackouts and zero other communication abilities.

## Internal Communication Basics

If you cannot do it first thing, or you want to improve what you can do to a better standard, then you will need to build the skill manually.

There are several parts to internal communication that can be worked on together or individually.

### Speaking Up From The Front

In order to communicate, you have to say things. So therefore, first you should practice talking to your headmates with regularity.

To reiterate: **The number one way to build connections in your system and strengthen your headmates is to talk to them!**

As you go about your day, try mentally narrating comments periodically about **literally anything** to those in your system. It doesn't necessarily have to be in words if that is not natural to you as a method of thinking, but it does have to be something. Try starting out with saying a sentence or two a couple times a day and work up from there.

It helps to believe very strongly that they can hear you, as belief that something can happen is a powerful force that pulls a lot of weight with system experiences.

It can also help quite a lot to mentally picture the concept of the headmate you are trying to speak to, rather than just doing this directionlessly. Imagine they are there and can hear you as you do. Eventually you should start adding pauses and questions as spaces for someone to respond.

If you need to work on making contact, this is a good first step. Its also useful to deliberately practice this if you can internally communicate, but you forget to do it regularly as it can instill the habit of checking in more often.

### How To Listen

Talking is fairly easy, but learning how to listen can be hard. If you have trouble hearing reliable responses (or responses at all) practicing how to listen can help with this.

#### Intentionality and Ownership

One important concept that the writers of this guide find to explaining what is necessary to properly listen without drowning out headmates with your own thoughts is the concept of Intentionality and Ownership.

Intentionality of thought is when a thought is very deliberately made. Stray 'junk thoughts' that just sort of kneejerk from nowhere and are usually nonsensical lack intentionality. For example when you look into the fridge and see you are nearly out of eggs and you consciously think to yourself and override anything else in your head with 'ok, I need to buy eggs' this is an intentional thought. When your headmate communicates with you this is also an intentional thought. You can feel the thought forming and the conscious intention of it, however it lacks *your* ownership.

Ownership, in turn, is your sense of ownership over that thought. It feels like you thought it, you ascribe your sense of self to that thought.

Thoughts inside your head have various levels of your intentionality and ownership, and learning how to discern thoughts

and the goal in learning how to listen is to be able t
temporarily reduce the thoughts that have a strong sense of BOTH your intentionality and your sense of ownership a little so there is more room for your headmate to speak.

#### Stepping Back

If you are used to having an iron grip on your thoughts, it can be hard to step back in this fashion. Learning to not control all the thoughts that happen within your head however is a skill that can be trained, particularly through the use of meditation.

Meditation is a mildly altered state of consciousness that is used for a great many things and there are a large variety of techniques and flavors of it to achieve said things. For our purposes, meditation is being used to get into a particular mind state of being more mentally passive than you generally are.

IMPORTANT: Meditation can be fraught for many systems, as plural folks are disproportionately dissociative and traumatized in such a way that many kinds of meditation can cause serious negative effects such as increased dissociation, flashbacks, panic attacks, and other mental distress.
It is worth being careful, paying attention to your symptoms and body, and at first only trying it when you do not need to be alert for awhile after.

If you experience negative effects when you try meditation there are resources for you:
- [Meditation Safety Toolbox](https://sites.brown.edu/britton/resources/meditation-safety-toolbox/)
- [Cheetah House](https://www.cheetahhouse.org/)

The flavor of meditation that is most useful for learning to listen to your headmates in this fashion is one where you learn to be a passive observer of your own thoughts for a bit.

##### Quick 'n Dirty Passive Observation Meditation

This is the meditation exercise the makers of this guide have found to be the most helpful for this purpose and minimally risky.

First, you need a comfortable spot to set for a bit and a good chunk of time in which you will not be disturbed or be expected to do anything important.

While the exercise itself will take 5-15 mins (5 mins is a good starting time, consider starting a timer to not go overboard), it may be best to reserve up to an hour in which nothing important will happen until you know how meditation effects you.

You can also try this technique just before bed, as you are already relaxed and you will not be expected to do anything for a good number of hours. This state is also useful for helping fall asleep for many people, so it serves a dual purpose.

Once you are comfortable in whatever position you want, you are just going to try to not deliberately think anything. You aren't trying to have *no* thoughts, but rather not think of anything purposefully in particular. Hold your thoughts like they are alive, you are observing, not forcing or deliberately engaging.
If you do this correctly, what will be left are mostly 'junk thoughts' that are barely coherent at best flicking around that you are not consciously thinking. You may also hear headmate chatter already, which will feel like relatively coherent thinking, but not thinking that *you* did. Intentionality without your ownership.

You may find usefulness in listening to music while you meditate, or listen to a guided meditation that also has the same goal of passive observation of thought. Fair warning that guided meditation is a bit more risky in terms of potentially triggering an issue.

The goal is to be able to hold this state for a good few seconds and to be able to call on it relatively quickly at will. You do not need to hold this passive observer state for the whole 5 minutes or anything, just a few seconds will do for the purposes of being able to step back to hear.
It will likely take a number of sessions to do this, and some people will struggle more than others.

When your practice time is up thats all the session you will do for the day. Check in with yourself after. Are you dissociated? Jumpy? Do you feel worse or just a little weird in a way that passes fairly quickly as you move around and pay attention tot he world around you again. If you feel marketedly worse after trying and simple grounding techniques are not working, meditation may not be for you at this point in time.

...And thats it!
Practice in this in small increments until you can step back comfortably at will to converse.

When you can step back to some level at will, try talking to your headmates then do so when waiting for a response.

This state makes it easier to hear headmates, as you aren't taking up as much space and dont need to be muscled out of the way.

##### Avoiding Listening Too Hard

Its a very paradoxial problem, but it is very much possible (and even common in newbies) that attempts to listen for headmates can end up quashing their voices instead.

If your attempts at communication as listed above have been going on for awhile and not been bearing any fruit, its worth trying to ascertain if this is happening.

You might find that stopping and stepping back that much to be counterproductive to listening for your system. If you are unable to discern quickly/easily if a given intentional thought has your ownership or not and hold back *only* the intentional thoughts that feel like you, then it may be best to not take the previously stated approach.

Instead, meditation exercises that are merely for just being aware of thoughts in your mind without trying to reduce your conscious thoughts may be more effective at letting you hear your headmates, especially at first.

### Visualization

Skill that can aid communication techniques. Visualization, if you are not aphantasic is very useful as an aid for many system skills.


### Getting Their Attention

Maybe you can do the techniques, but you have a hard time making your headmates aware of you. This is the section to help with that.

#### Front Pulls And Triggers

Front pulls and triggers are stimuli that bring headmates towards the front, with triggers having the connotation of something more automatic and negative (though positive triggers exist). If your system struggles with co-consciousness, you may need to try to induce that headmate coming to front to some level to communicate with them, especially at first.

Look back on the things that have caused headmate activity before (ideally things that were neutral to pleasant rather than things that seem to cause them distress) and try to do those things to try to tempt them to come forward. (listening to music, doing certain hobbies, going to certain places, wearing certain clothes, etc)

As they start to come to awareness, try doing the communication test again, it might be easier to interact with them.

#### Signatures

One technique for identification and visualization of your headmates is by training signatures. Signatures are condensed collections of sensory associations of a given headmate- for example a specific color, a spatial direction, an ideal form of theirs, a specific scent or item and so forth called up together.

With a signature, you can then have a clearer picture of the headmate you are trying to contact, and may in turn have both an easier time both hearing a message from them without it getting lost in the noise and an easier time sending a message in the correct direction.

### Speaking Up From The Back

From the other side, those who have trouble talking from the back have to build the mental strength to speak up. That is, they have to practice talking as well in order to get better at it.

Those of you who aren't fronting? You have to want it too. You have to take the space that you want to have, you have to put in effort to engage so that you can have the skills you wish. Remember that you are allowed to take up space, too. Its *your* life as well.

At first it will be difficult and tiring. You may have a hard time getting your words across and using the thought train to think and speak at first- and that at first may take a very long time. Start small and practice frequently to build stamina, but eventually there will be results.

### Inner World Use

One can also use the inner world to communicate if a given system needs a more involved experience to interact properly.

If you can only internally communicate through the inner world, it may be advantageous to have daily (or more often) meetings in the inner world to check in and converse with whoever is at front.
