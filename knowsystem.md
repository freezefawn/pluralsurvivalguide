# Getting To Know Your System

Now that you know you're plural, its time to start getting to know your system.

There is a lot of ground to cover here, and much of what you will be doing in these early stages you will be doing in some form over and over in your system journey as you discover more and more things about your plural experience.

Much of this will involve learning some level of certain system skills detailed in [Improving & Establishing System Skills](systemskills) to aid in this and is as such intended to be a companion to this article.

Some systems do this process with the help of a therapist, but it is **fully possible** to improve your experience without the oversight of the psychiatric industry or the use of psychiatric-approved techniques.

We strongly recommend writing down all the information you learn about your plural experiences somewhere- as this can be very helpful in making sense of the patterns present, having records to fall back on, and combating memory issues.
If you ever intend to go to therapy in the future, it also can be helpful to show them that your experiences have been going on for awhile. [System journaling] is touted everywhere for a reason.


## Attitude Going In

Your attitude going into this is fairly important.
It is best to approach learning about your system with an open mind. Being open to things in your system being different from how you expect (or even better: avoiding having any strong expectations at all) can prevent you from missing important things about your experience.

It is also a good idea to remember that your understanding of your system will likely change quite a bit over time. Everything from general headcount to disorder status to your theories and frameworks can change as you gain new perspective and grow and its important to not shy away from facing this fact.
Many systems are deeply concerned with having the 'right' labels ASAP and never ever being seen as 'going back on' labels once declared -something that the current community culture does not help with in the slightest. This is deeply detrimental to your wellbeing and growth as a system. Learn to accept and be okay with your labels and understanding changing over time. Its not a betrayal or wrong or lying or anything else, its just you adjusting to new information at your disposal and discovering more about yourselves over time. You and your system will change over time and this is ok, everyone does.


## Baby's First Headmate Search

One of the first things people tend to end up doing when they discover or suspect they are plural is figuring out at least some of who is in their system.
Many systems will then proceed to continue to discover and make contact with emerging or newly forming system members throughout their plural journey.

To do this, first look at your experiences, can you pick out recurrent patterns of identity, beliefs, behavior, and preferences that are different to normal? Perhaps you might have curious spells of not remembering something or feeling weird? Are there things that seem to get the attention of one of your maybe-headmates? Thoughts that don't seem like yours in general or feel 'out of place' are also of note. Try making record of these things over time and see if patterns of clusters of these things emerge.

Writing down what things happen just before or during your system experiences that might be causing them as well as what those experiences are can help you find these patterns. Look for similar behaviors, triggers, and identity traits that could indicate different system members.

NOTE: Some headmates (particularily those in more disorderly systems) will try to hide from you when/if they notice you are looking for them.
This can look like anything from simply not seeing any signs of them for awhile to them actively messing with your memory of them, the concept of plurality, or the things they are doing. Try not to take this personally or take the temporary raido silence as a sign you aren't actually plural. This usually is a defense mechanism, not malice.
Be patient, welcoming, and consistent, yes, even if they do seem to be doing this out of spite. Even headmates that do not like you deserve to be treated fairly.
It may take awhile to confirm the presence of headmates that are resistant to being noticed in this manner. Again: **Be patient**. It may take weeks, it may take months, it may even take years.

You can also communicate with them to ask them who is there and establish first contact, if that is available for you right away.


## First Contact

At some point you are going to need to establish contact to help aid in working together if you are not in contact already. To do this, refer to our guide, [Communication 101].

REMEMBER: They are ALSO often learning that they are also not alone in THIER head during this time. That sort of thing is, for many people scary and emotionally destabilizing.
Try to be understanding of unusual or rude behavior. The exestential discomfort can cause a lot of stress and can make one lash out. Its a major adjustment period to get used to the idea of being plural, so its important give them grace as they sort through the emotions that this causes. You would want the same, no?



## Establishing Rapport
Once you have made contact; you need to start learning how to live with each other and build your relationship going forward.

Treat them like people approach and treat them like parts approach. Different systems are hurt or helped by each.
