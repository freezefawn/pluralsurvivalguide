# Getting To Know Your System

Now that you know you're plural, its time to start getting to know your system.

There is a lot of ground to cover here, and much of what you will be doing in these early stages you will be doing in some form over and over in your system journey as you discover more and more things about your plural experience.

Much of this will involve learning some level of certain system skills detailed in [[Improving & Establishing System Skills](systemskills)] to aid in this and is as such intended to be a companion to this article.

Some systems do this process with the help of a therapist, but it is **fully possible** to improve your experience without the oversight of the psychiatric industry or the use of psychiatric-approved techniques.

We strongly recommend writing down all the information you learn about your plural experiences somewhere- as this can be very helpful in making sense of the patterns present, having records to fall back on, and combating memory issues.
If you ever intend to go to therapy in the future, it also can be helpful to show them that your experiences have been going on for awhile. [System journaling] is touted everywhere for a reason.


## Attitude Going In

Your attitude going into this is fairly important.
It is best to approach learning about your system with an open mind. Being open to things in your system being different from how you expect (or even better: avoiding having any strong expectations at all) can prevent you from missing important things about your experience.

It is also a good idea to remember that your understanding of your system will likely change quite a bit over time. Everything from general headcount to disorder status to your theories and frameworks can change as you gain new perspective and grow and its important to not shy away from facing this fact.

Many systems are deeply concerned with having the 'right' labels ASAP and never ever being seen as 'going back on' labels once declared -something that the current community culture does not help with in the slightest. This is deeply detrimental to your wellbeing and growth as a system. Learn to accept and be okay with your labels and understanding changing over time. Its not a betrayal or wrong or lying or anything else, its just you adjusting to new information at your disposal and discovering more about yourselves over time. You and your system will change over time and this is ok, everyone does.


## Baby's First Headmate Search

One of the first things people tend to end up doing when they discover or suspect they are plural is figuring out at least some of who is in their system.
Many systems will then proceed to continue to discover and make contact with emerging or newly forming system members throughout their plural journey.

To do this, first look at your experiences, can you pick out anything that might be a headmate? Maybe a too willful 'original character' or 'imaginary friend'? Perhaps recurrent patterns of identity, preference, and behavior shifts? Recurrent unusual memory issues? Thoughts that don't seem like yours in general or feel 'out of place'? Try making record of these things over time and see if patterns emerge.

Write down what seems to get the attention of these maybe-headmates, and what things happen just before or during your system experiences that might be causing them as well as what those experiences are, also. Anything that happens and what might have caused it. You are looking for patterns to see if you can  nail down the general shape of these headmates and what they are like.

You can also (and probably should) try communicating with them to ask them who is there and establish first contact, if that is available for you right away.

**NOTE:** Some headmates (particularily those in more disorderly systems) will try to hide from you when/if they notice you are looking for them. This can look like anything from simply not seeing any signs of them for awhile to the headmate actively messing with your memory to make you forget them, the concept of plurality, or the things that they're doing. Try not to take this personally or take the temporary raido silence as a sign you aren't actually plural. This often is a defense mechanism borne of fear- try not to reinforce that fear.

Be patient, welcoming, and consistent, yes, even if they do seem to be doing this out of spite. Even headmates that do not like you and are actively trying to shut you out deserve to be treated fairly.

It may take awhile to confirm the presence of headmates that are resistant to being noticed in this manner. Again: **Be patient**. It may take weeks, it may take months, it may even take years.


## First Contact

At some point you are going to need to establish contact to help aid in working together if you are not in contact already. To do this, refer to our guide, [Communication 101](communication).

REMEMBER: They are ALSO often learning that they are not alone in THIER head during this time. That sort of thing is for many, quite scary and emotionally destabilizing.
Try to be understanding of unusual or rude behavior. The exestential discomfort can cause a lot of stress and can make one lash out. Its a major adjustment period to get used to the idea of being plural, so its important give them grace as they sort through the emotions that this causes. You would want the same, no?



## Establishing Rapport
Once you have made contact; you need to start learning how to live with each other and build your relationship going forward.

There are two angles to take with this; the 'people' approach and the 'parts' approach.

The people approach is to think of your headmates as you would other people in how you reason how to interface with them. It would be rude to not ask another person that you live with their opinion on things that effect them, so you check in with your headmates to see how they feel about whatever it is. Other people like to be treated like people and respected in their seperate wants and needs and autonomy, so you do that. You socalize with them regularily and include them in important decisions and try to give them time and space to self-actualize and make their own decisions.

The parts approach is to think of your headmates as parts of yourself when you interact with them. You need to treat yourself kindly, including the parts of you that you might not be comfortable or familliar with. You build a better relationship to yourself through allowing yourself to express and welcome those parts of yourself and check in with how those parts of you are feeling.

Different systems are helped by different approaches, and the approach that helps may change over time, or might be a combination of the two. Both approaches have merits in different situations (for example very seperate systems versus less seperate systems), and pushing one over the other only harms large swaths of the community.

The medical community (and most of society really) pushes the parts view aggressively, and as a result some parts of the community can sometimes overcompensate towards the people view in response. It is worth giving a different approach a shot if the way you are currently trying is not working.

There is no wrong way to be plural!

This can be difficult, and goes in tandem with establishing rapport with your headmates.
