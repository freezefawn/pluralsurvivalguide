# Getting To Know Your System

Now you know that you are plural, its time to start getting to know your system.

This covers a lot of ground, and you will be likely doing some variation of these techniques over and over for a very long time- as many systems will be continually learning new things about their system throughout their lives.

Much of this will involve learning some level of certain system skills detailed in [Improving & Establishing System Skills] to aid in this and is as such intended to be read in psuedo-tandem to it.

Some systems do this process with the help of a therapist, but it is **fully possible** to improve your experience without the oversight of the psychiatric industry.

**FOR LEGAL REASONS:** The techniques to do this should not be taken as medical advice, rather as community wisdom. **This is NOT sanctioned by any medical oversight board.** You have been warned.

If you are intending to do this largely by youself(ves), we strongly recommend writing down all the information you learn about your plural experiences somewhere- as this can be very helpful in making sense of the patterns present, having records to fall back on, and combating memory issues.
If you ever intend to go to therapy in the future, it also can be helpful to show them that your experiences have been going on for awhile. System journaling is touted everywhere for a reason.

We have a guide on [System Journalling] that may be helful to peruse.


## Baby's First Headmate Search

One of the first things people tend to end up doing when they discover or suspect they are plural is figuring out at least some of who is in their system.
Many systems will then proceed to continue to discover and make contact with emerging or newly forming system members throughout their plural journey.

To do this, first look at your experiences, can you pick out recurrent patterns of identity, beliefs, behavior, and preferences that are different to normal? Perhaps you might have curious spells of not remembering something or feeling weird? Thoughts that don't seem like yours in general or feel 'out of place' are also of note. Try making record of these things over time and see if patterns emerge.

Writing down what things happen just before or during your system experiences that might be causing them as well as what those experiences are can help you find these patterns. Look for similar behaviors, triggers, and identity traits that could indicate different system members.

You can also communicate with them to ask them who is there and establish first contact, if that is available for you right away.


## First Contact

At some point you are going to need to establish contact to help aid in working together if you are not in contact already. To do this, refer to our guide, [Communication 101].


## Establishing Rapport
Once you have made contact; you need to start learning how to live with each other and build your relationship going forward.
