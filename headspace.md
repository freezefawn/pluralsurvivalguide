# Headspace

### What is the headspace?

Different people have different perspectives on what a headspace -otherwise known as a inner world, wonderland, or mind palace- is, but its generally considered to be a place within or connecting to one's mind that interacts with plurality in interesting and often useful ways.

From a strict psychological-only perspective, the headspace -also known as a wonderland, inner world, or mind palace- is a thought construct of a location of some kind. This construct may be consciously or unconsciously generated by the system.
For systems with spiritual or metaphysical components, this place can also be experienced as an external or partially external/'real' space the system is connected to governed by very different rules unique to that system.

Many systems have to intentionally create their headspace before being able to use it, but plenty also have a self-generating headspace or have system members who already gave it form consciously or subconsciously.

Systems who feel their headspace is fully psychologically based tend to (but do not always) have some level of control over its contents and often have to make it manually. In systems that have more metaphysical explanations for their headspace, this control is often considerably less and the headspace often generates itself. This is by no means a rule- but there is a notable pattern.

It is worth noting that singlets may also have an inner world if they desire.



A headspace is useful for aiding in:

- Communication by affording more in-depth visualization of headmates and system phenomena.
- Switching through intensive visualization.
- Memory recall and lowering dissociative barriers between headmates.
- Co-consciousness by visualizing where headmates who are not fronting are and giving them something to do and pay attention to when not fronting.
- Processing trauma and other mental stressors through metaphor.
- Meditation focus and daydream escape to improve mood.

Not to mention its an intensive creative project to mess around with and can be done collaboratively!



### How to get to your headspace:

You simply imagine it and hold the thought lightly enough that your headmates may alter the thought or otherwise add onto it.
The same principle generally applies for systems with more metaphysically effected inner worlds- think on it until you are connected then hold the control of the space lightly.
Indeed, most systems access the inner world in a 'shallow' manner- that is, it is not 1:1 with real life. Its just a detailed daydream.
Arguably its a kind of daydream wholesale, just one that everyone in the system is playing with at once.
Some systems can immerse so deeply it IS 1:1 with real life, but this is not the norm.

Sometimes you may know you have an inner world but cannot access it very well, in which case the debugging section further down may prove useful.

Other times, its because you simply do not have an inner world to begin with. Ergo;


### How do you make a headspace?
In short- you imagine it over and over and then you have one. It can be anything you and your system want.

To be more in-depth;
The headspace is basically like a daydream. You create it in much the same way.
Start small to be safe, for example imagine in detail a table or couch. It doesnt have to be that, but it should be something fairly small. Get very detailed with it. When you can call up that thought easily, imagine yourself standing near it, or sitting down on it.
Now invite someone in your system to play with it with you and hold the thought gently like its alive. If it feels like the thought is changing on you in a deliberate way, then this might be a headmate. Let it happen and see what occurs.

The goal here is to have a conversation with someone in your system in this space. If it works, congrats. You now have a headspace.
If the meeting went well enough, keep doing this and perhaps add more features, such as a room around you and a door into it. You can change it later if you have to.

Over time you build the space to look how you and your system want.

So for systems that **dont have spiritual components**, the headspace (also known as the inner world, wonderland, etc) is **a thought construct**. Its a **bit like daydreaming**, but its a specific space that has been daydreamed so many times by different headmates that it 'sticks' and becomes **very easy to imagine** in a very detailed way that feels almost real.

Think of the headspace like a **complex and immersive thought**. You see the headspace by **making one and imagining it and inviting others to play with the thought with you**, or by **going to one that has been already constructed in this way** by someone or something in the system.

Many systems **have to create their headspace** before being able to go there, but many also have one or more headmates that have **already made it to some level** consciously or subconsciously.

Systems with **psychologically based headspaces tend to have some level of control** over its contents- as you just **imagine it different over and over until it overrides the previous version**. Sometimes **only some headmates** can do this however and they may be **currently in hiding**, or the headspace has a **dedicated fragment whos only purpose is to upkeep the headspace**.

This may make altering or accessing the headspace tricky, as the given headmates **may not have invited you to play with it yet** for whatever reason.

Some systems believe their headspace is an **outside plane or world**, and they tend to experience their headspace **not being so mutable** with just thought. We will focus on psychologically based headspaces here, however.

  

When being in the headspace when you are not at front, because of the way fronting and switching works for many systems, **your system may not keep memories from when you are not at front**.

Therefore, **you may not remember what you did in the headspace from your perspective or at all.**

**When you access the headspace from the front, you are far more likely to remember** (unless another headmate is taking those memories from you) as you are **'writing' the memory with the primary internal narrative** (or Only internal narrative if you usually switch by 'passing the I').

When you are at front, you go into the headspace by **imagining it in heavy detail and then imagine yourself in it and walking around**. Hold the thought construct **gently** so others can play with it too. It may help to **close your eyes or lie down** when you do this. **Meditation** can also help.

It really is that easy!

Its important to keep in mind- **you can just Make Your Own headspace if others are not letting you play with theirs**, or there is **some barrier preventing you from doing so** despite their best efforts in letting you join in.

There is **no limit to the number of headspaces** as they are just detailed thought constructs- not real places or whatever.

You can even later mash them together if you want.

  

To answer your asked question: **Because of this, any system can theoretically make and/or access the headspace at any time and at any age. Age and time are completely irrelevant.**

  

**To answer your unasked question** of 'Im having trouble accessing the headspace that other headmates seem to be able to access, what is going on and how do I do that?'

First see if your **understanding of what the headspace is** was blocking you from accessing it. Newbies often think the headspace is a 'real place' that is very solid for all systems that they go when not fronting and can remember it all perfectly and get panicked when they are not having that experience. This is very much not true. **The headspace is often just a multiplayer daydream.**

Next, **talk to your headmates**, see if they are intentionally blocking you from using it. Sometimes this is the case. **The person who made the headspace may also just not know you exist** and so hasnt invited you.

If either of those do not work, then it may be **a dissociative barrier thing**. In which case, work with your system until those barriers go away. **Its not time dependent, its healing dependent.**

**If you are young** (minor), this may not go away until you have **left home** as it may be there to **protect you from your current situation**.

In the meantime you will just have to live with not having that experience.

Having a headspace and/or being able to access the headspace that your system uses is not the end all be all of system experience. It is ok to not have what is considered a more 'typical' experience of having one.



You dont need a headspace and many systems dont have one- not even a featureless void/room.

If you do have a headspace it doesn't even need to be very detailed or vivid to 'count' as one.

Think of it like a more in-depth communication where instead of passing a thought that is a 'verbal' sentence in words, the thought is a full sensory experience of a daydreamed place.

Some systems are capable of this kind of thing, and some are not. Some like doing it, and some don't find it worth doing.

For a long time we didnt have a headspace, but we found for us personally, having a thought construct to imagine over and over as tool to aid in certain things was worth the effort of developing it.

We want to be clear- **any skill you can work on with a headspace you can work on without it**, it just might be more difficult.

Things a headspace can help with:

- More in-depth and nuanced communication
    
- Aiding in switching via visualization 'mind tricks'
    
- Recalling buried memories and reducing dissociative barriers between headmates via visualization 'mind tricks'
    
- Processing trauma through metaphor
    
- Aiding in helping headmates be co-conscious more often if they have something to do other than paying attention to front
    
- If you switch in a possessive way (ie, you keep the narrative 'I' when you switch out) it may make switching more pleasant and reawarding if you have something to do other than watch the body being puppeted.
    
- Making the space where your headmates 'go' when not at front be more easily conceptualized
    
- General visualization of system phenomena made easier
    

  

Cons:

- If you dont have one already it can be difficult to make and maintain in the brain as you imagine it over and over
    
- It can take a long time and a lot of effort to make one if you are not used to daydreaming
    
- Malevolent/maladaptive headmates may use the headspace to be unkind to you in a new way
    

  

Its up to you if its worth it for your system to use!



n terms for reasons against creating an inner world, there are really only three notable ones;

- If you dont want to create one, it would just be a waste of time because your system doesn't want it.
    
- If you have aphasia or any other difficulty imagining things you may have a harder time making an inner world and thus it may be frustrating to try to do and not really go anywhere.
    
- If you have headmates that try to harm the body and are generally malevolent, some may use the headspace to do more harm than they otherwise would be able to. If you have a headmate that might try this, it might be worth waiting until that headmate chills out a bit.
    

  

For tips and tricks;

We would recommend viewing and building your headspace from the perspective that its just a more complex thought than you are used to- as the very least at first- because it kind of is!

You as a system are imagining a very complex thing a bunch of times until it becomes very easily imagined and then passing that thought back and forth between the members of your system to play with it. This means you can do a lot more things than you think you can with a headspace and the headspace is also not as vivid as most people think it is. Its not always a fully 5-sense-immersed ordeal.

Imagine a space. Imagine it REALLY detailed. Ok now imagine your headmate and then let go of it and invite them to take form there. Now talk to them and step back on controlling the daydrema a bit. See if they will play with you.
you might only be able to reliably communicate in a more in depth sort of meditative state like this.
