# Headspace

## What Is It?

Different people have different perspectives on what a headspace is, but its generally considered to be **a place within or connecting to one's mind** that interacts with plurality in interesting and often useful ways.

From a strict psychological-only perspective, the headspace (also known as a wonderland, inner world, or mind palace) is a thought construct of a location of some kind that has been imagined repeatedly until it is very easy to recall. This construct may be consciously or unconsciously generated by the system.
For systems with spiritual or metaphysical components, this place can also be experienced as an external or partially external/'real' space the system is connected to governed by very different rules unique to that system.

You can think of it like very visualization-heavy and in-depth internal communication where instead of passing thoughts back and forth that are 'verbal' sentences, the thought is instead a full sensory experience of being in a place.

Many systems have to intentionally create their headspace before being able to use it, but plenty also have a self-generating headspace or have system members who already gave it form consciously or subconsciously.

It is worth noting that singlets may also have an inner world if they desire.


## Why Is It Useful?

A headspace is useful for aiding in:
- Better communication by affording more in-depth visualization of headmates and system phenomena.
- Switching through intensive visualization.
- Memory recall and lowering dissociative barriers between headmates.
- Co-consciousness by visualizing where headmates who are not fronting are and giving them something to do when not fronting.
- Processing trauma and other mental stressors through metaphor.
- Meditation focus and daydream escape to improve mood.
- Creative outlet to build things in collaboratively.

There are also reasons not to utilize a headspace to keep in mind:
- If you have to make one from scratch it can be hard work that you may not have time and energy for.
- If the level of immersion you may expect from it is not worth the amount of work for you.
- If you have headmates that behave in maldaptive or antagonistic ways, they may be able to utilize the headspace as a new tool to enact harmful behavior.
- If you don't want to create one, for whatever reason.

Its up to you if its worth working for or not. We want to be clear- **any skill you can work on with a headspace you can work on without it**, it just might be more difficult.


## Clearing Misconceptions

This is is one of the system experiences people have the most misconceptions about.

One of the biggest incorrect assumptions people have is the idea that one's headspace is always 1:1 with reality and going to it therefore feels like literally being transported to another world that is as tangible, immersive, and detailed as real life.

In actuality; **The headspace is essentially a multiplayer daydream**. This means that its going to be about the same level of intensity and immersion as any of your other daydreams for most people. Higher immersion and detail can be learned, and some systems have more unusual experiences, but it is very much not the average experience.

It is very much standard to not be fully all 5-senses immersed to the point you lose touch with whats happening to your meatspace body.

Related to this, there is also the misconception that there is something wrong if you cannot recall what you were doing in headspace if the front was not paying attention to it. This is very standard actually. While some systems appear to be able to make memory while not utilizing the front, this is not common.

From a scientific-only perspective, **true multitasking is not possible; you cannot simultaneously think of two things at once**, only flick between different things rapidly. So what is actually happening here for these systems, from a scientific perspective, is more likely either retroactive memories that are generated when they return to front and recall them or dissociation preventing the fronting party from perceiving the share of the brain's attention that is going to what that headmate is thinking and doing.

One can then in this vein think of the internal thought stream like a resource that must be shared to think and make memory. The headspace has to run in this same resource, which is why the attention of the front is important to remembering what you have done in it.

Newbies often think the headspace is a 'real place' that is very solid for all systems that they go when not fronting and can remember it all perfectly and get panicked when they are not having that experience. This is very much not true.

Its also commonly assumed that everyone has and needs a headspace. Not true! **Many systems have to make a headspace to have one, or choose to never have a headspace**. You do not need any sort of headspace -not even a featureless void- if you do not want one. A headspace can be helpful, yes, but its not for everyone. You can also make and have as many headspaces as you want at once and they can change radically over time.


## Accessing Headspace:

If you know you already have a headspace the process is fairly simple; **get daydreaming and hold the daydream thought construct lightly enough so that the rest of your system can play with it too.**

That is, you get comfortable and then imagine the space in vivid detail. Then you imagine yourself a body in there while holding this daydream gently enough that your headmates can add to it as well.

It may also be helpful to visualize a connecting process (such as imagining opening a door, or a loading screen or whatever feels appropriately symbolic for you) or get into a meditative state in order to facilitate better immersion.

Some systems can also have luck asking a headmate to bring them in as part of the process.


## Baby's First Headspace

As previously stated several times, your headspace is essentially a fancy daydream.

You create it much the same way you do any very detailed daydream you keep coming back to- you imagine it over and over in detail until its easy to call up quickly.

A good place to start in this fashion is very simply. Start small with something like a single table/couch/bench- maybe even just a floor or a black void if you find that too much. Anything that feels right for you. A spot a couple people can hang out and interact. Imagine it vividly over and over -its look, what it feels like when touched, etc- until you can call up the mental image of it pretty readily. Now imagine yourself alongside the object, possibly interacting with it if you like (ex- sitting down on the couch) and invite your headmates to play with this space too.

Treat it like you do standard communication, when you listen for their turn playing with it, you hold the thought gently. If it feels like the thought is changing on you in a deliberate way, then this might be a headmate. Let it happen and see what occurs.

You may also need to forcibly imagine your headmate in this space too and then let them take control of their body-construct you made them.

If it worked and you had a conversation in that space, congrats! You have a headspace now. From here you can work to build the space however you want and make it more vivid if desired.

## Inner World Building

If you already have a headspace you can access, but you want to change aspects of it, that is very possible for many systems.

Generally speaking, you change it by imagining it differently in heavy detail over and over until it 'sticks', though systems with more real-feeling headspaces (such as many of those with heavy spiritual elements) may need to build and change it manually once you have accessed it, rather than just imagining it differently.

This may also be complicated if only some headmates may alter the headspace, or if the headspace itself is conscious enough to resist changes. In this case, you will need to find who is responsible and either ask permission to be able to change it, or ask for them to change it directly.

### Idea Help

The sky is the limit for one's headspace- it can be quite literally anything you can imagine.
However, if you would like some ideas and tips:

Start small and basic as building more complex things and keeping them can be a lot of work. You can make things more complex over time.

If multiple members of your system can front, having different system members working on the headspace while in front is a good idea.

your headspace can be anything. Might need help figuring out and researching cool stuff to do to make. Some ideas for things to make:

- Utility spaces (places in the headspace used for visualization exercises to help aid performing system skills like being co-con, switching and fronting, where memories are stored, if your system is a gateway system a gateway so you can control traffic flow, etc)
- A general central meeting space
- Individual spaces that each headmate can customize to their liking

useful things to worldbuild and visualize in general list
- build in a game (like minecraft, the sims, vrchat, etc)
- use fantasy mapmaking tools (such as ones intended for ttrpgs)
- look at and study archetecture and home design (or alternatively natural world scenery)
- write descriptions of it down that you want. get detailed.

as everyone has to use it, consult the whole system


## Debugging:


If you have trouble accessing an inner world of any kind, it may also be because you simply do not have one.

Its important to keep in mind- **you can just Make Your Own headspace if others are not letting you play with theirs**, or there is **some barrier preventing you from doing so** despite their best efforts in letting you join in.



Next, **talk to your headmates**, see if they are intentionally blocking you from using it. Sometimes this is the case. **The person who made the headspace may also just not know you exist** and so hasnt invited you.

If either of those do not work, then it may be **a dissociative barrier thing**. In which case, work with your system until those barriers go away. **Its not time dependent, its healing dependent.**

**If you are young** (minor), this may not go away until you have **left home** as it may be there to **protect you from your current situation**.

In the meantime you will just have to live with not having that experience.

Having a headspace and/or being able to access the headspace that your system uses is not the end all be all of system experience. It is ok to not have what is considered a more 'typical' experience of having one.


you can even make multiple headsapce if you want or need to. Cant get into the headspace eveyrone else cna use? cant change your current headspace to your liking? cant decide how to alter your headspace. You can have multiple headspaces per system.


This may make altering or accessing the headspace tricky, as the given headmates **may not have invited you to play with it yet** for whatever reason.
