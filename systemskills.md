# Improving and Establishing System Skills

So your system functions a certain way.

What if we told you it didn't have to be that way?

What if we said you didn't *have* to deal with being unable to switch, you didn't *have* to go without the inner world you wished you had, and you didn't *have* to exclusively communicate with notes and occasionally meditation?

Well its true!

Many systems are capable of improving things like communication, co-consciousness, separation, memory sharing, the construction of and clarity of the inner world, and fronting/switching ability through practice and effort- regardless of origin or disorder status.

Improving these skills can help improve your system's happiness, quality of life, and ability to function. If you have a goal in this respect, its **very possible** you can learn how to do it though frequent practice as a system.

There are a number of community resources for learning these skills, and we have created some ourselves.

If this sounds like tulpamancy practices to you- well it pretty much it is! Tulpamancy is based on the principle that through repeated practice you can create the neural pathways to 'learn' to have your brain configured a certain way. Many psychotherapy techniques are built on the same principle.

This principle can be applied regardless of your origin theory or disorder status.

Professional help for systems will usually take a different but still somewhat similar route to tulpamancy and this guide. Instead of encouraging separateness, the medical 'party line' is integration of the system into one unified person. Its still practicing neural pathways, just in the direction of learning singlethood over plurality.

THIS IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY: HERE BE DRAGONS.

In following these guides, you are DIY messing with your neural pathways in a way science has done **very little** research with. By choosing to use the guides listed, **you accept that you alone are taking responsibility for what happens next**. There are no shrinks here. These are trails blazed BY the people FOR the people with little to no oversight and scientific testing.

We are all boldly wading into murky water and sharing what works. This is back-alley brainhacking, not medical help.

THIS IS NOT ENDORSED BY ANY THERAPEUTIC INSTITUTION OR CERTIFIED INDIVIDUAL AND DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE.
BY BEING IN FAVOR OF HEALTHY MULTIPLICITY THIS GUIDE IS INHERENTLY CONTRARY TO THE OFFICAL STANCE OF THE ISSD

Most people who do things like this have neutral to positive experiences and acquire some benefit, but some people may instead get a increase in negative symptoms.

In particular, some people with CDDs creating new headmates find that this can cause their system to destabilize and split more frequently, and some people with experiences of psychosis trying to learn imposition have have found that this can cause an increase in uncontrolled hallucinations. This is not all negative reports, however.

Doing many these techniques also tends to make you 'more plural' so if you are working towards Final Fusion with a therapist, many these guides may be counterproductive.

You have been warned.

### How to judge if its 'making you worse'

If you have an increase in...
- Difficulty with participating in life (job, school, housework, hobbies, socalizing, etc).
- Headaches or migraines when you try practicing them.
- Serious internal conflict or uncontrolled headmate formation.
- Any other undesired (new or otherwise) symptoms when you try learning these skills.

Generally speaking, this means you should stop what you are doing.

You might be able to do them further along in your system journey- but it may never be helpful for some systems and that's ok.

If you go slow, pay attention, and track your wellbeing with system journaling, you can notice if these things occur more easily.
