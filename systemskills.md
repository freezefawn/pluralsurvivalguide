# Improving and Establishing System Skills

So your system functions a certain way.

What if we told you it didn't have to be that way?

What if we said you didn't *have* to deal with being unable to switch, you didn't *have* to go without the inner world you wished you had, and you didn't *have* to exclusively communicate with notes and occasionally meditation?

Well its true!

Many systems are capable of improving things like communication, co-consciousness, separation, memory sharing, the construction of and clarity of the inner world, and fronting/switching ability through practice and effort- regardless of origin or disorder status.

Improving these skills can help improve your system's happiness, quality of life, and ability to function. If you have a goal in this respect, its **very possible** you can learn how to do it though frequent practice as a system.

There are a number of community resources for learning these skills, and we have created some ourselves.

If this sounds like tulpamancy practices to you- well it pretty much it is! Tulpamancy is based on the principle that through repeated practice you can create the neural pathways to 'learn' to have your brain configured a certain way. Many psychotherapy techniques are built on the same principle.

This principle can be applied regardless of your origin theory or disorder status.

Professional help for systems will usually take a different but still somewhat similar route to tulpamancy and this guide. Instead of encouraging separateness, the medical 'party line' is integration of the system into one unified person. Its still practicing neural pathways, just in the direction of learning singlethood over plurality.


Disclaimer In The Interest Of Informed Consent:
THIS IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY- HERE BE DRAGONS.
You are DYI messing with your neural pathways in a way science has done very little research with.
By choosing to learn system skills you lack, you accept that you are taking responsibility for what happens next.
There are no shrinks here. These are trails blazed by the people for the people with little to no oversight and scientific testing.
We are all boldly wading into murky water and sharing what works.

THIS IS NOT ENDORSED BY ANY THERAPEUTIC INSTITUTION OR CERTIFIED INDIVIDUAL AND DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE.

BY BEING IN FAVOR OF HEALTHY MULTIPLICITY THIS GUIDE IS INHERENTLY CONTRARY TO THE OFFICAL STANCE OF THE ISSD

Most people who do things like this have neutral to positive experiences and acquire some benefit, but some people who have CDDs who practice tulpamancy and related techniques on their system may find they instead get a notable increase in negative symptoms. These are mostly people who were purposefully creating a new headmate wholesale, but this is not every report.
Doing these techniques also generally speaking makes you 'more plural' so if you are working towards Final Fusion, this may be counterproductive.

If this scares you or makes you not wish to do this, then by all means, return to only getting information and help from your therapist- otherwise read on.



How to judge if its 'making you worse'

If...
- You have an increase in undesired symptoms when you try learning these skills.
- You have difficulty with life tasks because of what you are doing.
- Its destabilizing your system numbers or causing serious internal conflict.
- It is giving you new undesired symptoms you have never experienced before.
- Its giving you migraines or headaches whenever you try doing it.

Generally speaking, this means you should stop what you are doing.

You might be able to do them further along in your system journey- but it may never be helpful for some systems and that's ok.

If you go slow, pay attention, and track your wellbeing with system journaling, you can notice if these things occur more easily.
