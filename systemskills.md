# Improving and Establishing System Skills

So your system functions a certain way.

What if we told you it didn't have to be that way?

What if we said you didn't *have* to deal with being unable to switch, you didn't *have* to go without the inner world you wished you had, and you didn't *have* to exclusively communicate with notes and occasionally meditation?

Well its true!

Many systems are capable of improving things like communication, co-consciousness, separation, memory sharing, the construction of and clarity of the inner world, and fronting/switching ability through practice and effort- regardless of origin or disorder status.

Improving these skills can help improve your system's happiness, quality of life, and ability to function. If you have a goal in this respect, its **very possible** you can learn how to do it though frequent practice as a system.

There are a number of community resources for learning these skills, and we have created some ourselves.

If this sounds like tulpamancy practices to you- well it pretty much it is! Tulpamancy is based on the principle that through repeated practice you can create the neural pathways to 'learn' to have your brain configured a certain way. Many psychotherapy techniques are built on the same principle.

This principle can be applied regardless of your origin theory or disorder status.

Professional help for systems will usually take a different but still somewhat similar route to most of the resources in this guide. Instead of encouraging separateness, the medical 'party line' is integration of the system into one unified person. Its still practicing neural pathways, just in the direction of learning singlethood over plurality.

THIS IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY: HERE BE DRAGONS.

In following these guides, you are DIY messing with your neural pathways in a way science has done **very little** research with. By choosing to use the guides listed, **you accept that you alone are taking responsibility for what happens next**. There are no shrinks here. These are trails blazed BY the people FOR the people with little to no oversight and scientific testing.

We are all boldly wading into murky water and sharing what works. This is back-alley brainhacking, not medical help.

THIS IS NOT ENDORSED BY ANY THERAPEUTIC INSTITUTION OR CERTIFIED INDIVIDUAL AND DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE.
BY BEING IN FAVOR OF HEALTHY MULTIPLICITY THIS GUIDE IS INHERENTLY CONTRARY TO THE OFFICAL STANCE OF THE ISSTD

Most people who do things like this have neutral to positive experiences and acquire some benefit, but some people may instead get a increase in negative symptoms.

In particular, some people with CDDs creating new headmates find that this can cause their system to destabilize and split more frequently, and some people with experiences of psychosis trying to learn imposition have have found that this can cause an increase in uncontrolled hallucinations. This is not all negative reports, however.

Doing many of these techniques also tends to make you 'more plural' so if you are working towards Final Fusion with a therapist, these guides may be counterproductive.

You have been warned.

### How to judge if its 'making you worse'

If you have an increase in...
- Difficulty with participating in life (job, school, housework, hobbies, socalizing, etc).
- Headaches or migraines when you try practicing them.
- Serious internal conflict or uncontrolled headmate formation.
- Any other undesired (new or otherwise) symptoms when you try learning these skills.

Generally speaking, this means you should stop what you are doing.

You might be able to do them further along in your system journey- but it may never be helpful for some systems and that's ok.

If you go slow, pay attention, and track your wellbeing with system journaling, you can notice if these things occur more easily.

## How To Build System Skills:

**PRACTICE.** Thats it.

No really, **practice is the name of the game** in learning skills. You practice whatever you want to get better at in order to strengthen that skill like you are exercising a muscle. There is no fast solution. Sorry.

And like if you are exercising a muscle, you need to **be careful not to overdo it** and tire yourselves out enough to require recovery time. Sometimes it cannot be helped, especially if your skills are very poor to start, but generally speaking you will want to stop practicing the skill BEFORE anyone involved starts to feel the strain in some form (generally a sense of mental tiredness, dissociation, or difficulty at continuing practicing the skill).

The frequency of your practicing is usually more important than the depth of it anyway, so its better to favor **quantity of sessions over quality of sessions**. Short frequent sessions are usually better than long intense ones in most cases as it minimizes recovery time and habit builds better.

As you practice you will likely become familliar with the sensation of **'head pressure'** which is a sort of pressure sensation in the head that is very commonly reported in people learning these skills. This is distinct from a headache in that it is a pressure sensation, not pain. **Head pressure is favorable, Headaches are not**. Stop your practicing session if you are feeling pain from it.

### Having Trouble With Skills?

If you are having trouble learning system skills despite regular practice, its important to remember that there is not some set hour count in which you will suddenly have it down- its more like physical therapy. For more disorderly systems in particular, learning system skills is healing, and your recovery will take as long as it takes.

Its also possible that you are just not in a good position to be doing that healing at the moment. If you are still in a stressful situation your brain will continue to do its best to try to protect you, and this means for many more dissociative systems that it will continue to try to keep dissociative barriers up. This can prevent you from gaining ground in a great number of skills.

In particular if you are a minor or otherwise still living at home and unable to leave, -even if you feel as though your situation may not be that bad- if you are having trouble learning skills it may be due to this fact.

You may have to do trauma healing work or change your living situation to make much progress.

With that out of the way;
