# Dragon's Plural Survival Guide

## What is this?
This is a guide about the topic of plurality, and is currently a work in progress!

## How to Use This Guide
Plurality can be a super tricky topic, and its even trickier to manage.
This becomes even moreso when one does not have access to a useful and understanding therapist or when one does not perfectly fit the medical model and ideas and treatment under it.

This is a guide that is intended to fill that gap and be a community-self-help resource.

The curators of this guide have noticed that many newbies have a hard time rooting around for good plural-related information, so this is intended to be an easier to access guide for all of that.

This guide was built in Obsidian and then exported to github via [Docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/)
It is intended to be read both in a loose order dictated on the sidebar and by skipping around to whatever catches your eye.

**LEGAL DISCLAIMER:** The information in this guide should not be taken as medical advice, rather as community wisdom. This is NOT sanctioned or tested by any medical oversight board and may have unintended negative conequences as a result. We are not liable for people treating this as a medical resource. **To reiterate: This is back-alley brainhacking, not medical help.** You have been warned.

## About The Curator
The Dragonheart Collective -also known as Dragon(s)- is a queer nonhuman multiple system.

They have identified as plural since late 2014, and decided to make this guide to coalesce knowledge from across the web on a variety of plural topics that are of concern.

As a system, they generally enjoy collecting information and engaging with fantasy media.
